# Datasets

The datasets used in tasks of join-aggregate estimation are CAIDA dataset and Zipf dataset with the skewness of 0, which is generated using Web Polygraph. We provide two small shards of CAIDA dataset in `./CAIDA/`. You can directly run our test cases using them. 

You can download the Zipf dataset from the link below.
